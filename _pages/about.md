I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), working with  [Prof. William Knottenbelt](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wjk/) and [Prof. Cong Ling](https://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~cling/). I completed my PhD at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). Previously, I obtained both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/).

My research interests encompass privacy and security challenges in decentralized and distributed computing systems, with a particular focus on cryptography, blockchain, and their practical applications. Currently, I am exploring the following topics:

- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Blockchain privacy, security, consensus, and applications </span>
- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Applied cryptography, including classical and post-quantum solutions</span>
- <span style="font-size:0.9em;"> Decentralized AI</span>

I welcome collaborations and discussions about research opportunities. Please feel free to reach out to me at <u>zhipeng.wang0x01[at]gmail.com</u>.
